A schedule optimizer for the U of C's Computer Science department written in Java.

It utilizes OR-Tree-Based Search and genetic algorithms to create an optimal assignment of courses / labs to time slots (optimality being defined as fulfillment of all hard constraints coupled with the minimization of all soft constraint penalties incurred).

This project was for an AI course I took in the Fall 2017.
